# Vertebrae

Vertebrae is [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) splitted into CommonJS modules. This modular approach is particularly useful when building isomorphic apps, where you only need certain parts of Backbone, e.g. you want React to handle the View handling but still need collections, models & events.

Vertebrae passes the Backbone test suite.
